### IoT problems

Building your own IoT devices is fun and often helps you solve real world problems. Controlling them often involves writing small applications and scripts that execute certain functions. That's all great, but at some point you probably want to get away from using a command line interface to call all your amazing Python-/Bash-/Whatever-Scripts.

### Meet Pioneer

A simple, reactive and secure web interface to call command line functions from everywhere, simple and intuitive!

### Features

* Single configuration file
* Clean, modern user interface
* User accounts
* SSL encryption out of the box
* One-time and toggle commands supported
* Schedule your commands to run at certain times
* Low performance requirements, runs perfectly on a Raspberry Pi
* Batteries included, single binary deploy (plus config.json)!

### Installation

Download the version matching your device/system below, create a file called `config.json` in the same directory (tip: copy and paste the example config from this repository to get the basic structure) and execute the binary! For best results, set it up so that the binary is executed at startup.

Alternatively, if you have a Go compiler installed you can just call `go get -v -u github.com/PiMaker/Pioneer`
